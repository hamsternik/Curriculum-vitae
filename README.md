#### CV of Homitsevich Nikita 

On me Debian *wheezy* was installed solely two packages: **texlive-latex-base** && **tex-gyre**. Also, if you first use TeX and LaTeX, i recommended install **texlive-full** package. It's easier and you wouldn't think about any packages, maybee, in first time.

*Involve this packages, nothing else was need to compile it into pdf cleanly.*

p.s. it my first real work with TeX, including and especially with Latex. So, don't take an example from me :)
